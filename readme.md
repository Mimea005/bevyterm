# Todo
- [x] Finish initialization of the 'CrosstermWindow' component
- [x] Dismantling the window on exit.
- [ ] Event handling
  - [x] Poll crossterm events
  - [ ] Create additional event streams that split up crossterm events to:
    - [ ] Input events
    - [ ] Mouse events
    - [ ] Window events (resize and focus)
- [ ] Display
   - How displaying something should look like.
   - Should text be its own primitive? (since the terminal is text based anyway)
