# Todo
- [x] Finish initialization of the 'CrosstermWindow' component
- [x] Dismantling the window on exit.
- [x] Event handling
  - [x] Poll crossterm events
  - [x] Create additional event streams that split up crossterm events to:
    - [x] Input events
    - [x] Mouse events
    - [x] Window events (resize and focus)
- [ ] Display
   - How displaying something should look like.
   - Should text be its own primitive? (since the terminal is text based anyway)
